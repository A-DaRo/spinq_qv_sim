Nice — below are the rewritten, pip-oriented dependency files and concise install guidance. All package version pins are **“equal or higher”** (`>=`) as you requested. I include:

* `pyproject.toml` (Poetry format) with `>=` constraints.
* `requirements_cpu.txt` (pip format).
* `requirements_gpu.txt` (pip format) that references the CPU file and adds GPU-accelerated packages.
* Short, precise installation notes (what to run and important GPU caveats).

Use these files directly in your repo. If you want, I can also produce a `requirements_dev.txt` for CI/dev tools only.

## Installation guidance (pip-based, CPU and GPU)

### CPU-only install (recommended first)

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements_cpu.txt
# then install your package in editable mode
pip install -e .
```

### GPU install (careful: match CUDA driver/toolkit)

1. **Check your NVIDIA driver / CUDA compatibility.** The CUDA version of your system driver must be compatible with the GPU wheels you install (CuPy, cuQuantum, jaxlib). If you don't control the driver, query `nvidia-smi` and note the driver and supported CUDA versions.

2. **Create and activate venv, then install base CPU deps**:

```bash
python -m venv .venv-gpu
source .venv-gpu/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements_cpu.txt
```

3. **Install GPU packages — recommended approach:**

   * **CuPy:** choose the wheel matching your CUDA (CuPy provides `pip` wheel tags such as `cupy-cuda121` for CUDA 12.1). Example (for CUDA 12.1):

     ```bash
     # Example: install CuPy for CUDA 12.1 (adjust for your CUDA)
     pip install cupy-cuda121>=13.0.0
     ```

     If a `cupy-cuda*` wheel is not available via pip for your platform, follow CuPy's install docs.

   * **cuQuantum (optional / vendor):** cuQuantum wheels may be distributed on NVIDIA channels or pip; check NVIDIA docs. Example:

     ```bash
     pip install cuquantum>=23.08.0
     ```

     If pip fails, fetch the appropriate wheel from NVIDIA/rapids channels.

   * **JAX / jaxlib:** **jaxlib wheels are CUDA + cuDNN specific**. The safest route is to follow official jax install instructions. Example pattern (replace with the exact wheel for your CUDA/cuDNN):

     ```bash
     # Example placeholder — replace with jaxlib wheel matching your CUDA:
     pip install --upgrade "jax>=0.4.14"
     # then install matching jaxlib wheel (example tag, adjust to your system)
     pip install --upgrade jaxlib==0.4.14+cuda12.cudnn86 -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_releases.html
     ```

     Consult [https://github.com/google/jax#pip-installation](https://github.com/google/jax#pip-installation) for the exact wheel.

4. **Install the package**

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Important GPU notes (short & critical)

* **Wheel compatibility matters.** If you install `cupy` or `jaxlib` wheels built for CUDA 12.1 but your driver supports only CUDA 11.8, you will get runtime errors. Always match wheel → CUDA runtime → NVIDIA driver.
* **If in doubt, use CPU-only environment for development and CI**, then enable GPU on validated machines (workstations or clusters) where the hardware/driver matrix is known.
* **Vendor libraries (cuQuantum, qsim) may require special access or wheels** — check vendor docs for where to fetch the correct wheels.
