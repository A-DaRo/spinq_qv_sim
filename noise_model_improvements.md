### **Critique of the Current Noise Model**

The fundamental weakness is the way gate error is constructed in `NoiseModelBuilder`. The model currently does the following:
1.  Takes a gate fidelity `F` (e.g., `F2 = 0.998`).
2.  Converts this directly into a large, dominant depolarizing probability `p_dep` (e.g., `p2 ≈ 0.00267`).
3.  Separately, it calculates small decoherence probabilities `p_amp` and `p_phi` from T1, T2, and the gate duration `τ` (e.g., `p_phi ≈ 0.0004`).
4.  It then composes these channels.

This approach is physically flawed because **gate infidelity is not an independent phenomenon; it is largely a *consequence* of decoherence and coherent control errors occurring *during* the gate's finite duration.** The current model effectively double-counts errors and, more importantly, severs the critical physical link between "how long a gate takes" and "how much error it accumulates." The large, constant `p_dep` term derived from fidelity swamps the smaller, time-dependent decoherence terms, explaining why varying `T2` or gate times has almost no effect on the final QV in your plots.

### **Proposed Improvements for a More Realistic Noise Model**

Here are four key improvements to create a more predictive and physically accurate simulation.

#### **1. A Unified and Constrained Gate Error Model**

This is the most critical improvement. Instead of treating fidelity and decoherence as separate inputs to be added together, we should use the experimental fidelity as a **total error budget** that must be filled by physically-motivated error sources.

**Conceptual Framework:**

The total infidelity of a gate is the sum of contributions from different physical mechanisms. The two primary ones are incoherent errors from environmental decoherence and coherent errors from imperfect controls.

$$
1 - F_{\text{total}} \approx \text{Error}_{\text{incoherent}} + \text{Error}_{\text{coherent}}
$$

The simulation should build the error model from the ground up using physical parameters and then scale or add a residual error term to ensure the total matches the experimental fidelity.

**Mathematical Formulation and Implementation Steps:**

1.  **Calculate the Decoherence Contribution:** For any gate of duration `τ`, first calculate the infidelity caused *solely* by T1 and T2 processes. This is the error the qubit would accumulate just by existing for that duration. The Kraus operators for the combined amplitude and phase damping channel (`E_decoherence`) can be constructed. The average fidelity of this decoherence channel is:
    $$
    F_{\text{decoherence}}(\tau, T_1, T_2) = \frac{d + \text{Tr}(M^\dagger M)}{d(d+1)}
    $$
    where `M` is the superoperator for the channel and `d` is the dimension (2 for one qubit, 4 for two). The infidelity is `1 - F_decoherence`.

2.  **Define the Coherent Error Contribution:** Model the coherent error as a small, systematic unitary rotation, `U_err`. For single-qubit gates, this could be an over-rotation `R(axis, ε)`. For two-qubit gates, this is often a residual `ZZ` interaction `exp(-iθ ZZ/2)`. The infidelity from this error source is approximately `Error_coherent ≈ c * ε^2` or `c * θ^2` for small angles `ε, θ`.

3.  **Create the Combined Error Channel:** The full gate operation `E_gate` is the composition of the ideal gate, the coherent error, and the decoherence:
    $$
    \mathcal{E}_{\text{gate}}(\rho) = \mathcal{E}_{\text{decoherence}} (U_{\text{err}} U_{\text{ideal}} \rho U_{\text{ideal}}^\dagger U_{\text{err}}^\dagger)
    $$

4.  **Introduce a Residual Depolarizing Term:** Calculate the fidelity `F_sim` of the combined channel `E_gate` constructed above. This fidelity is now directly dependent on `τ`, `T1`, and `T2`. Compare this to the target experimental fidelity `F_exp`. The gap between them represents unmodeled stochastic errors (e.g., high-frequency noise). Bridge this gap with a final, small depolarizing channel.

    The probability `p_dep_residual` for this channel is calculated to make the total fidelity match the experiment:
    $$
    F_{\text{exp}} = F_{\text{sim}} \times F_{\text{depol, residual}}
    $$
    Solving for `p_dep_residual` ensures the model is constrained by experimental data while being built on physical principles.

**Impact:** This change will make the simulation results highly sensitive to `T2` and gate durations. If a gate is slower, `τ` increases, `F_decoherence` drops, and the total error increases, lowering the QV. This will restore the physically-expected correlations that are currently missing.

#### **2. Spatially Correlated Noise: Crosstalk**

The current model assumes errors on different qubits are independent. In reality, crosstalk is a dominant error source in multi-qubit devices.

**Mathematical Formulation:**

1.  **Coherent ZZ Crosstalk:** This is a parasitic interaction between neighboring qubits `i` and `j` that is always "on" to some degree. It's modeled by a unitary `U_{ZZ} = \exp(-i \zeta_{ij} Z_i \otimes Z_j t)`, where `ζ_ij` is the crosstalk strength. This operator should be applied during any idle time slice and during single-qubit gates on either qubit `i` or `j`, as it dephases the qubits relative to each other.

2.  **Microwave/Control Crosstalk:** When a control pulse for a gate is applied to a target qubit `i`, some of that field leaks to a neighboring spectator qubit `j`. This is modeled as a multi-qubit unitary error. If the intended operation is `U_i`, the actual operation during that time slice becomes:
    $$
    U_{\text{crosstalk}} = U_i \otimes V_j
    $$
    where `V_j` is an unwanted small rotation on the spectator qubit `j`. For example, `V_j` could be `R_x(α * θ)` if `U_i` was an `R_x(θ)` gate, with `α` being the crosstalk percentage.

**Impact:** Crosstalk penalizes dense circuits where many gates happen in parallel. This makes the transpiler's qubit mapping and scheduling far more critical to the final QV result, reflecting a key challenge in real hardware development.

#### **3. Advanced State Preparation and Measurement (SPAM) Errors**

SPAM errors are more complex than a simple fidelity loss. A more realistic model should capture their specific nature.

**Mathematical Formulation:**

1.  **State Preparation Error:** Instead of initializing to a perfect `|00...0>`, initialize to a mixed state. A common model is that each qubit `i` is reset with some probability `p_i` to the wrong state:
    $$
    \rho_{0, \text{imperfect}} = (1 - p_i) |0\rangle\langle0| + p_i |1\rangle\langle1|
    $$
    This initial mixedness will propagate through the circuit.

2.  **Measurement Error (POVM Model):** Real measurements are imperfect and can be asymmetric (e.g., it's easier to distinguish `|1>` from `|0>` than vice versa). This is best modeled by a Positive Operator-Valued Measure (POVM). For a single qubit, instead of projectors `|0><0|` and `|1><1|`, we use measurement operators:
    $$
    M_0 = \begin{pmatrix} \sqrt{1-p_{1|0}} & 0 \\ 0 & \sqrt{p_{0|1}} \end{pmatrix}, \quad M_1 = \begin{pmatrix} \sqrt{p_{1|0}} & 0 \\ 0 & \sqrt{1-p_{0|1}} \end{pmatrix}
    $$
    Where `p_{i|j}` is the probability of measuring outcome `i` when the qubit was in state `|j>`. The probability of getting outcome `k` from state `ρ` is `Tr(M_k^\dagger M_k ρ)`. This captures the full statistics of measurement errors.

**Impact:** A detailed SPAM model correctly attributes errors to the beginning and end of the computation. Since QV circuits have a large output state space, measurement errors can significantly impact which outputs are identified as "heavy," directly affecting the HOP score in a non-trivial way.

#### **4. Time-Dependent and Non-Markovian Noise**

The quasi-static noise model for T2* is a good first step. It can be extended to be more realistic.

**Mathematical Formulation:**

1.  **Low-Frequency Noise (1/f):** The `QuasiStaticSampler` correctly samples a detuning once per circuit. To improve this, the `sigma` of this sampling should not be constant. In spin qubits, charge noise can be a dominant factor, and its magnitude can fluctuate on the timescale of minutes. You could model `sigma` itself as a slowly varying parameter drawn from another distribution for each "experimental run" within a campaign.

2.  **Drifting Coherent Errors:** Systematic errors like gate over-rotations are not perfectly stable. They drift over time due to calibration inaccuracies. The coherent error angle `ε` should not be a fixed constant. It could be modeled as:
    $$
    \epsilon_{\text{run}} = \epsilon_{\text{mean}} + \delta\epsilon
    $$
    where `δϵ` is a small offset sampled from a Gaussian `N(0, σ_drift^2)` once per experiment or even per circuit, similar to the quasi-static detuning. This captures the reality of "calibration drift."

**Impact:** These models capture the run-to-run variations seen in real experiments. They would increase the variance of the HOP scores (the error bars in your first plot would become larger and more varied), providing a more realistic picture of the statistical confidence in a given QV result. This also means that simply running more circuits might not always narrow the confidence interval, as it would be limited by physical device drift, not just statistical sampling noise.
