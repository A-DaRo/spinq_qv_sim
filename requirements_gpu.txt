# GPU-acceleration packages (install versions equal or higher than shown)
# NOTE: GPU wheels are CUDA-version dependent. See install notes below.
cupy>=13.0.0
cuquantum>=23.08.0

# JAX: high-performance array / autodiff on GPU
# jax requires a jaxlib wheel that matches your CUDA/cuDNN combination.
# Install jax (>=) and then the matching jaxlib wheel as described below.
jax>=0.4.14

# Optional high-performance simulators (install if available for your platform)
# qsim / qsimcirq wheels are platform-dependent and may require extra steps
# qsimcirq>=0.13.0    # uncomment if you have qsimcirq wheels compatible with your system

# NOTE: if you need GPU PyCUDA or other low-level packages, add them as required.
